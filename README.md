## Overview:
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science and artificial intelligence that deals with the interaction between computers and human languages. The primary goal of NLP is to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate natural language, the way humans do.NLP involves various techniques, including computational linguistics, machine learning, and statistical modeling. These techniques are used to analyze, understand, and manipulate human language data, including text, speech, and other forms of communication.
In this project, we'll classify customer complaints into different categories using Natural Language Processing. The dataset contains customers who have narrated their complaints and what was the product.We have used nltk python library to apply Natural Language Processing.
## Dataset:
[Consumer Complaints Dataset for NLP] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/consume-complaints-dataset-fo-nlp)

### Requirements:
To run the notebooks and analysis in this project, you'll need the following:
- Python 
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Required Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn,nlpk

### Results:
The SVC-based NLP model demonstrated impressive accuracy with a score of 87%. This result showcases the model's ability to effectively classify and perform well on the task at hand.

### How to Reproduce:
For those interested in reproducing our results, follow these steps:

- Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Install Dependencies: Install the required libraries and dependencies.
- Dataset: Ensure you have access to the same dataset or replace it with a similar dataset that matches the task.
- Run the Code: Execute the code for training and evaluating the SVC-based NLP model.
- Evaluate Performance: Compare the accuracy obtained with the reported accuracy of 87%.
